PopCodecs
======================
This is a repository of c# scripts (I've tried to keep these as single-header as possible) to decode and encode various file formats. (3D formats, video containers, audio etc)

They are designed to be `byte[]` orientated for streaming and agnostic purposes, with no dependencies other than sibling files (and in some cases, PopUnityCommon)
